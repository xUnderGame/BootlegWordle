# BootlegWordle
Yet another Wordle ripoff.

This time... Wordle is in a C# Console app! It uses simple console functions and settings and (should) work flawlessly.

Data "samples" used in this program:
- [Words - lorenbrichter (es)](https://github.com/lorenbrichter/Words/blob/master/Words/es.txt)
- [Words - lorenbrichter (en)](https://github.com/lorenbrichter/Words/blob/master/Words/en.txt)

## Wait... But how does it work?
*Now*, that's a good question.

Firstly, the program sets up the Console window (title, width...) and then brings you to the main menu.

### **Main menu**

In the main menu, you have 4 options to your disposal. You can:
- 1 Play the game. (You can save/load savefiles with game information. Goes to game menu.)
- 2 Change language (This swaps "en" and "es" languages)
- 3 View saved games. (Shows all the savefiles, with its attempts, wordle and other information.)
- 4 Exit the game.

### **Game "menu"**

In this menu, the player will be stuck until they run out of attempts, leave by closing the program/pressing "esc", or guessing the correct wordle. Neat, huh?

<br>
Anything more? ...no? Well that's <strong>good enough for you</strong>. Go on ahead and try it out, go have so fun.
